# Latte Locator 

The official repository for Latte Locator, aka Starbucks Locator. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/latte-locator/9nblggh0f2cn 

Initially named "Starbucks Locator", this app was the only way Starbucks customers on Windows Phone 7 and 8 were able to get features like their Android and iOS comadres. 

After it became popular, Starbucks took notice and issued a Cease and Desist for trademark violation. The app was then rebranded to **Latte Locator** and re-published.
